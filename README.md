## DQA visualization 

This repository contains ideas for data quality visualizations generated for the DQA-viz project

### Sketeches for Apr 4 meeting

For this week, I generated some preliminary sketches for assessing data quality using the **plausibility** dimension of the harmozied DQ framework. I was inspired by the [breakout detection](https://blog.twitter.com/2014/breakout-detection-in-the-wild) and [anomaly detection](https://blog.twitter.com/2015/introducing-practical-and-robust-anomaly-detection-in-a-time-series) tools from twitter.
